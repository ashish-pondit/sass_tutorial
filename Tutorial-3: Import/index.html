    <h1>Sass @import and Partials</h1>
    <p>
        Just like CSS, Sass also supports the @import directive.

        The @import directive allows you to include the content of one file in another.

        The CSS @import directive has a major drawback due to performance issues; it creates an extra HTTP request each
        time you call it. However, the Sass @import directive includes the file in the CSS; so no extra HTTP call is
        required at runtime!

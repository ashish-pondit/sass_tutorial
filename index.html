        <h3>Why use SCSS?</h3>
        <p class="para1">
            SCSS, which stands for Sassy Cascading Style Sheets, is a syntax for the CSS preprocessor Sass
            (Syntactically Awesome Stylesheets). It's used to style the visual elements of a webpage, including buttons,
            sliders, images, color schemes, fonts, themes, and layouts. As a superset of CSS, all valid CSS is also
            valid SCSShttps://www.upwork.com/resources/what-is-scss.

            The term SCSS is an acronym for Sassy Cascading Style Sheets. It is basically a more advanced and evolved
            variant of the CSS language. Natalie Weizenbaum and Chris Eppstein created it, and Hampton Catlin designed
            it.

        <p class="para1">
            SCSS is necessary because it introduces features that enhance CSS, making it more powerful and easier to
            maintain. These features include:

        <ul>
            <li>Variables</li>
            <li>Nesting</li>
            <li>Mixins</li>
            <li>Partials and Import</li>
        </ul>

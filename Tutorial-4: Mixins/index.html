    <h1>Sass @mixin and @include</h1>
    <p>
        The <span class="mark">@mixin</span> directive lets you create CSS code that is to be reused throughout the
        website.

        The <span class="mark">@include</span> directive is created to let you use (include) the mixin.
    </p>

    <p>
        Mixins are very useful. Check <a href="https://sass-lang.com/documentation/" target="_blank"
            class="link">official doc</a> here.
